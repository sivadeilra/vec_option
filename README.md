# vec_option::VecOption

`VecOption<T>` is a collection that is semantically equivalent to `Vec<Option<T>>` but which
uses a different memory representation. This representation can be more efficient
for some algorithms.

See the crate docs for more information.

This crate has not yet been published to `crates.io`. I want to get some community feedback
before publishing.
